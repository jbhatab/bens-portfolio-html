### Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/jbhatab/bens-portfolio-html.git

```

Or you can download it as a zip.

Open the index.html file with google chrome. You can set up a server if you want, but it's not necessary. Ask me questions if you are curious about this. 

### Contents

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

[Animte.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)

[WOW.js](http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/)


Bootstrap is a great tool to easily make decently looking websites. Read their docs to see how it works. 

I added a simple jquery click on the second div to show you how to use animations. 

I added animate.css and wow.js for you to easily incorporate animations. 

### Bonus - parallax
Use skrollr to setup parallax.
